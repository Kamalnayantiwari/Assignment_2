    "#give a detailed description with example\n",
    "# A while loop in Python is used to repeatedly execute a block of code\n",
    "# as long as a certain condition is met.\n",
    "# The loop will keep running as long as the condition is True,\n",
    "# and will exit when the condition becomes False.\n",

    "# while condition:\n",
    "#     # Code to be executed\n",

    "# Print the numbers from 1 to 10\n",

    "# On each iteration of the loop, the value of counter is printed,\n",
    "# and then incremented by 1.\n",
    "# The loop will exit when the value of counter becomes greater than 10.\n",
    "# The while loop is useful when you don't know in advance how many times\n",
    "# you need to loop, and you want to keep looping until a certain condition is met.\n",
